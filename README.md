# FormulaOne
Project for CMIS 201 at Frederick Community College

Anyone interested in Formula 1 or racing can play this game casually on any machine that can run Java programs and has a display. This game serves as a little window into the world of Formula 1, and as more development happens they will be able to tune their car to a state of better performance just like real F1 engineers are required to do.
